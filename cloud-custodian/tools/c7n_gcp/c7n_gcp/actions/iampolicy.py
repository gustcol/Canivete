class SetIamPolicy(MethodAction):
    """ Sets IAM policy. It works with bindings only.

        The action supports two lists for modifying the existing IAM policy: `add-bindings` and
        `remove-bindings`. The `add-bindings` records are merged with the existing bindings, hereby
        no changes are made if all the required bindings are already present in the applicable
        resource. The `remove-bindings` records are used to filter out the existing bindings,
        so the action will take no effect if there are no matches. For more information,
        please refer to the `_add_bindings` and `_remove_bindings` methods respectively.

        Considering a record added both to the `add-bindings` and `remove-bindings` lists, which
        though is not a recommended thing to do in general, the latter is designed to be a more
        restrictive one, so the record will be removed from the existing IAM bindings in the end.

        There following member types are available to work with:
        - allUsers,
        - allAuthenticatedUsers,
        - user,
        - group,
        - domain,
        - serviceAccount.

        Note the `resource` field in the example that could be changed to another resource that has
        both `setIamPolicy` and `getIamPolicy` methods (such as gcp.spanner-database-instance).

        Example:

        .. code-block:: yaml

            policies:
              - name: gcp-spanner-instance-set-iam-policy
                resource: gcp.spanner-instance
                actions:
                  - type: set-iam-policy
                    add-bindings:
                      - members:
                          - user:user1@test.com
