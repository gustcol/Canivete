.. _gcp_gettingstarted:

Getting Started (Beta)
======================

The GCP provider (Beta) is an optional package which can be installed to enable
writing policies which interact with GCP related resources.


.. _gcp_install-cc:

Install GCP Plugin
------------------

First, ensure you have :ref:`installed the base Cloud Custodian application <install-cc>`. 
Cloud Custodian is a Python application that supports Python 2 and 3 on Linux and Windows. 
We recommend using Python 3.6 or higher.

Once the base install is complete, you are now ready to install the GCP provider package
using one of the following options:

Option 1: Install released packages to local Python Environment
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install c7n
    $ pip install c7n_gcp


Option 2: Install latest from the repository
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/cloud-custodian/cloud-custodian.git
    $ pip install -e ./cloud-custodian
    $ pip install -e ./cloud-custodian/tools/c7n_gcp

.. _gcp_authenticate:

Connect Your Authentication Credentials
---------------------------------------

In order for Custodian to be able to interact with your GCP resources, you will need to
configure your GCP authentication credentials on your system in a way in which the
application is able to retrieve them.

Choose from one of the following methods to configure your credentials, depending on your
use case. In either option, after the configuration is complete, Custodian will implicitly
pick up your credentials when it runs.

GCP CLI
"""""""
If you are a general user accessing a single account, then you can use the GCP CLI to
configure your credentials.

First, `install <https://cloud.google.com/sdk/install>`_ ``gcloud`` (the GCP Command Line Interface).

Then run the following command, substituting your username:

.. code-block:: bash

    gcloud auth application-default login

Executing the command will open a browser window with prompts to finish configuring
your credentials. For more information on this command,
`view its documentation <https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/login>`_.

Environment Variables
"""""""""""""""""""""
If you are planning to run Custodian using a service account, then configure your credentials
using environment variables.

Follow the steps outlined in the 
`GCP documentation to configure credentials for service accounts. <https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started>`_

.. _gcp_write-policy:

Write Your First Policy
-----------------------
A policy is the primary way that Custodian is configured to manage cloud resources.
It is a YAML file that follows a predetermined schema to describe what you want
Custodian to do.

There are three main components to a policy:

* Resource: the type of resource to run the policy against
* Filters: criteria to produce a specific subset of resources
* Actions: directives to take on the filtered set of resources

In the example below, we will write a policy that filters for compute engine
resources, and then stops each resource.

Filename: ``custodian.yml``

.. code-block:: yaml

    policies:
      - name: my-first-policy
        description: |
          Stops all compute instances that are named "test"
        resource: gcp.instance
        filters:
          - type: value
            key: name
            value: test
        actions:
          - type: stop

.. _gcp_run-policy:

Run Your Policy
---------------
First, ensure you have :ref:`configured one of the supported authentication mechanisms <gcp_authenticate>`.

Next, run the following command to execute the policy with Custodian:

.. code-block:: bash

    GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="project-id" custodian run --output-dir=. custodian.yml

If successful, you should see output similar to the following on the command line::

    2016-12-20 08:35:06,133: custodian.policy:INFO Running policy my-first-policy resource: gcp.instance
    2016-12-20 08:35:07,514: custodian.policy:INFO policy: my-first-policy resource: gcp.instance has count:3 time:1.38
    2016-12-20 08:35:08,188: custodian.policy:INFO policy: my-first-policy action: stop: 3 execution_time: 0.67

You should also find a new ``my-first-policy`` directory with a log and other
files (subsequent runs will append to the log by default, rather than
overwriting it).

See :ref:`filters` for more information on the features of the Value filter used in this sample.
