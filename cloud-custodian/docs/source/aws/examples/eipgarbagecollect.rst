EIP - Garbage Collect Unattached Elastic IPs
============================================

Use the ``mark-for-op`` action to mark a resource for action later. One common
pattern to follow is to mark a resource with an operation (example: release) in
n days. In the subsequent days leading up to the marked date, run a unmark or
untag policy if the resource has become compliant in the mean time.

You can use this principle to implement garbage collection on resources. In this
example, Custodian will first mark all unattached Elastic IPs for removal. The
next policy will then unmark any EIP that has been attached and has the
``maid_status`` tag, indicating that it had been previously marked. Finally, the
third policy will filter in any resources that have been marked and run the
``release`` action.

It is important to note that the release policy will need to be run on the day that
the resource is marked for, else the resource will still exist in the account.
The mark operation only tags the resource with metadata about the upcoming operation.
Operationally, the policy still must be executed on the day that is specified in
the tag.

Note: all resources that are ``marked-for-op`` up to and including the current
date will be filtered in when utilizing the ``marked-for-op`` filter.
