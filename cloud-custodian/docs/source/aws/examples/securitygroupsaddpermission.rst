Security Groups - add permission
=================================================

The following example policy will automatically create a CloudWatch Event Rule
triggered Lambda function in your account and region which will be triggered
anytime a user creates or modifies a security group. This provides near real-time
auto-remediation action (typically within a minute) of the security group change.
Having such a quick auto-remediation action greatly reduces any attack window!
User defined rule is added to the filtered results.
