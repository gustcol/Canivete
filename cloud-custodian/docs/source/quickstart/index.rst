Install Cloud Custodian
-----------------------

Cloud Custodian is a Python application and supports Python 3 on Linux, MacOS and
Windows.

We recommend using Python 3.6 or higher.

Linux and Mac OS
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To install Cloud Custodian, just run::

  $ python3 -m venv custodian
  $ source custodian/bin/activate
  (custodian) $ pip install c7n       #Install AWS package
  (custodian) $ pip install c7n_azure #Install Azure package
  (custodian) $ pip install c7n_gcp   #Install GCP Package

Windows (CMD/PowerShell)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To install Cloud Custodian, just run::

  $ python3 -m venv custodian
  $ ./custodian/Scripts/activate
  (custodian) $ pip install c7n       #Install AWS package
  (custodian) $ pip install c7n_azure #Install Azure package
  (custodian) $ pip install c7n_gcp   #Install GCP Package


Docker
++++++

To install via docker, just run::

  $ docker pull cloudcustodian/c7n

You'll need to export cloud provider credentials to the container
when executing. One example, if you're using environment variables for provider
credentials::

  $ docker run -it \
    -v $(pwd)/output:/home/custodian/output \
    -v $(pwd)/policy.yml:/home/custodian/policy.yml \
    --env-file <(env | grep "^AWS\|^AZURE\|^GOOGLE") \
       cloudcustodian/c7n run -v -s /home/custodian/output /home/custodian/policy.yml


.. _explore-cc:

Explore Cloud Custodian
-----------------------

Run ``custodian -h`` to see a list of available commands.

Run ``custodian schema`` to see the complete list of cloud resources against
which you can run policies. To invoke command-line help with more information
about policy schema details, run ``custodian schema -h``.

Run ``custodian schema <cloud-provider>`` to see the available resources for a
specific cloud provider: ``custodian schema aws``

Run ``custodian schema <cloud-provider>.<resource>`` to see the available
filters and actions for each resource.

Drill down to get more information about available policy settings for each
resource, where the model for the command is::

  $ custodian schema <cloud>.<resource>.<category>.<item>

For example::

  $ custodian schema aws.s3.filters.is-log-target

provides the following information::

  Help
  ----

  Filter and return buckets are log destinations.

  Not suitable for use in lambda on large accounts, This is a api
  heavy process to detect scan all possible log sources.

  Sources:
    - elb (Access Log)
    - s3 (Access Log)
    - cfn (Template writes)
    - cloudtrail

  :example:

      .. code-block: yaml

          policies:
            - name: s3-log-bucket
              resource: s3
              filters:
                - type: is-log-target

  Schema
  ------

  {   'additionalProperties': False,
      'properties': {   'type': {   'enum': ['is-log-target']},
                        'value': {   'type': 'boolean'}},
      'required': ['type'],
      'type': 'object'}


Additionally, you can use the schema command to view information on the different
supported modes in Cloud Custodian::

  $ custodian schema mode

.. _cloud-providers:

Cloud Provider Specific Help
----------------------------

For specific setup isntructions for AWS, Azure, and GCP, visit the relevant getting started
page.

- :ref:`AWS <aws-gettingstarted>`
- :ref:`Azure <azure_gettingstarted>`
- :ref:`GCP <gcp_gettingstarted>`

Troubleshooting & Tinkering
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The policy is validated automatically when you run it, but you can also
validate it separately:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ custodian validate custodian.yml

You can also check which resources are identified by the policy, without
running any actions on the resources:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ custodian run --dryrun -s . custodian.yml

.. _monitor-cc:

Monitor resources
-----------------

Additional commands let you monitor your services in detail.

You can generate metrics, log outputs, and output to blob storage in each of the different
providers (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform).

For detailed instructions on how to add metrics, logging, and blob storage output for the
different clouds, check out the cloud provider specific pages:

- :ref:`AWS <aws-gettingstarted>`
- :ref:`Azure <azure_gettingstarted>`
- :ref:`GCP <gcp_gettingstarted>`

For details, see :ref:`usage`.


.. _editor-integration:

Editor Integration
------------------

If your preferred editor supports language servers, you can configure
it to provide completion and validation while authoring policies.

First generate use custodian to generate a json schema file::

  custodian schema --json > schema.json

Next install a YAML plug-in for your editor, like `YAML for Visual Studio Code
<https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml>`_ or
`coc-yaml for coc.nvim <https://github.com/neoclide/coc-yaml>`_. Both plug-ins
use the `yaml-language-server
<https://github.com/redhat-developer/yaml-language-server>`_ under the hood.

You'll then need to configure your plug-in to use the generated `schema.json`
as the schema for your policy files. For example in Visual Studio Code,
navigate to the settings for the YAML plug-in and under Schemas, edit
configuration file and add the following schema configuration::

      "yaml.schemas": {
        "./schema.json": "*yml"
      },

Note the path to schema.json can either be either relative or the full path.

You'll now have completion and validation while authoring policies.

.. image:: c7n-editor.png

Note if you're authoring policies in json you can also configure the
json-language-server for the same.

Also, if you're seeing errors like ``'Request textDocument/hover failed with
message: Cannot read property '$ref' of null'`` try re-creating your
schema.json file.

.. _tab-completion:

Tab Completion
--------------

To enable command-line tab completion for `custodian` on bash do the following one-time steps:

Run:

.. code-block:: bash

    activate-global-python-argcomplete

Now launch a new shell (or refresh your bash environment by sourcing the appropriate
file).


Troubleshooting
+++++++++++++++

If you get an error about "complete -D" not being supported, you need to update bash.
See the "Base Version Compatability" note `in the argcomplete docs
<https://argcomplete.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#global-completion>`_:

If you have other errors, or for tcsh support, see `the argcomplete docs
<https://argcomplete.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#activating-global-completion>`_.

If you are invoking `custodian` via the `python` executable tab completion will not work.
You must invoke `custodian` directly.
